    <h2>Covid-19 Update:</h2>
    <p>Ontario is opening schools for in-person learning as at January 17/22.  Unfortunately, we do not fall under that directive.  We fall under directive #17 "Businesses That Provide Teaching And Instruction" which reads "Businesses that provide in-person indoor teaching and instruction are closed." Therefore, all tutoring must be online until January 26/22 unless otherwise directed. Please check our website for updates.<br>Thank you for your understanding!</p>
